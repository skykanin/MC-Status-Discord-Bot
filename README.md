# MC-Status-Discord-Bot

This discord bot is designed to check status of MC servers. It is a really basic bot with few commands, maybe I will impliment more
commands later.

## Running the bot

To run this bot you will need to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).
If you want to use this bot for your personal server you need to provide the token in the `key.json` file. Follow the
format in the `exampleKey.json` file. Then simply run the bot by running `npm install` followed by running the bat file or running `npm start`.

## Commands

This discord bot has _two_ commands none of which are case sensitive:

- `!hello`
- `!status`

### !hello

The command is just `!hello`

### !status

The command is `!status [ip]`. Write the Minecraft's Server IP after the command to pass is as an argument to the bot.
